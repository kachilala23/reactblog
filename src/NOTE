React is component based. A component is made up of a template and logic.
JSX allows us to easily mix javascript and html and in the background babel coonvert all the JSX into html
and it renders that html to the DOM.

Further more, a component is a function and we return things from that function generally a jsx template.
Then at the bottom we export that function so it can be used somewhere else by importing it where
we want to use it.

You can write any valid javascript inside the component before we return the jsx.
In older versions of react i.e. before react version 17 you need to import react before a component can work.
Using a functional component you may not need to do that.

We can create variables before the return keyword in a component e.g. string and number.
The only thing we can't create and return is boolean and objects.

Most of the things we output in our jsx are usually returned as strings.
Home.js shows how to handle events in react within jsx.



Working with multiple components
The App component is usually refered to as the root component. Most the times other components that we create
are nested in the app component.
