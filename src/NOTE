React is component based. A component is made up of a template and logic.
JSX allows us to easily mix javascript and html and in the background babel coonvert all the JSX into html
and it renders that html to the DOM.

Further more, a component is a function and we return things from that function generally a jsx template.
Then at the bottom we export that function so it can be used somewhere else by importing it where
we want to use it.

You can write any valid javascript inside the component before we return the jsx.
In older versions of react i.e. before react version 17 you need to import react before a component can work.
Using a functional component you may not need to do that.
